# Rustlings

>> $ rustlings
Is this your first time? Don't worry, Rustlings is made for beginners!
We are going to teach you a lot of things about Rust, but before we can
get started, here are some notes about how Rustlings operates:

1. The central concept behind Rustlings is that you solve exercises. These
   exercises usually contain some compiler or logic errors which cause the
   exercise to fail compilation or testing. It's your job to find all errors
   and fix them!
2. Make sure to have your editor open in the `rustlings/` directory. Rustlings
   will show you the path of the current exercise under the progress bar. Open
   the exercise file in your editor, fix errors and save the file. Rustlings will
   automatically detect the file change and rerun the exercise. If all errors are
   fixed, Rustlings will ask you to move on to the next exercise.
3. If you're stuck on an exercise, enter `h` to show a hint.
4. If an exercise doesn't make sense to you, feel free to open an issue on GitHub!
   (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). We look at every issue, and sometimes,
   other learners do too so you can help each other out!
